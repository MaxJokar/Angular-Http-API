Almost all Angular applications need to make HTTP requests
 to a back-end web API to retrieve, save, update, and
  delete data (CRUD Operations).

POST − Create
GET − Read
PUT − Update
DELETE − Delete

The Angular HTTP course teaches basic, as well as
advanced features of Angular HTTP Communication.
